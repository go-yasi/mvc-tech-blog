This site was built completely from scratch, then deployed to Heroku. It follows the MVC structure, uses Handlebars.js as the templating language, [Sequelize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequelize) as the ORM, and the [express-session](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session) npm package for authentication.",
